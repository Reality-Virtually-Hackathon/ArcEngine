# What it does
ArchEngine reimagines how architects will convey design intent to builders. It uses Revit, the industry standard design application, to create interactive augmented reality views that can be used to illustrate how architectural details should be built. This allows for multiple people to view a AR view of the scaled model on the iPad. It also allows for builders to view a full scale model in-place for renovation retrofits.

# How we built it
Built with Unity using the latest Apple ARKit plugin.
